\title{Generate Three Panel (Node) Graph Display}
\usage{
generateNewValidation(paneled = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{TRUE/FALSE}{boolean toggling paneled display. Defaults to T.}
}
\description{
This function generates a 3-panel visualization of the same graph. The first graph (left) depicts the small-world graph itself. The second graph (middle) depicts the same graph from the left, but with predicted noticeability scores overlayed on top. The third graph (right) displays a heatmap visualization to help illustrate the data from the second (middle) graph. This function focuses on node data only. The related generateNewValidationEdges functions provides similar functionality for edges in graphs.
